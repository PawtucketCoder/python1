# Flask CTA Page

This project is a simple Flask application designed to demonstrate the creation of a call-to-action (CTA) web page. It's aimed at beginners looking to get hands-on experience with Flask, web development, and server-side programming.

## Description

The Flask CTA Page project is a learning tool for those interested in web development with Python. It covers key Flask concepts such as routing, template rendering, and form handling. The project showcases how to build a simple yet functional web page that prompts users to take action—be it signing up for a newsletter, registering for an event, or any other action relevant to the user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.8 or later)
- Flask (version 2.0 or later)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-cta-page.git
cd flask-cta-page
python -m venv venv
# For Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# For Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

### Running the Application

To run the application locally:

\```bash
flask run
\```

This will start the Flask development server, and you'll be able to access the application by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the CTA page by filling out the form and submitting it. The application demonstrates how to handle form data and can be extended to include database integration, user authentication, and more.
